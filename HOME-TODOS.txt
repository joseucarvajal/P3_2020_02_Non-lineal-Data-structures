 ------------------ Deadline: thursday, August 20 -----------------------------
	1. To set up a new GitHub repository
	2. To create a new Eclipse project. To solve the following requirements:
		There are going to be a handful of students. Each student is going to have: name, payment.
		The system should be able to: 		
			1. To create a method: "getDiffAvg(....)" Difference between payment average and the student with the greatest payment value.
				Ej:
					Students:
						Pepito		2000
						Carlitos	500
						Miguelito	700
						Natalia		3500
						Jose		2000
						
					Avg: 1740
					Student with greatest payment: 3500
					
					Output:
						Difference between payment average and student with the greatest payment is: 1760
						
			2. To shape the stack trace to show the behavior for "getDiffAvg(...)" starting from the main(....) method.
				This shape, must be done in your own notebooks.
				Inside the newly JAVA project: to create a new folder with the screenshots taken out of your notebooks.
				
			3. Into screenshots folder: attach a screenshot of your program running.
						
	3. To upload the newly created project to GitHub.
	
	4. To create workspace to present (explain) your project.
	
	5. Download the project from GitHub and test it within the newly created workspace
	
------------------ Deadline: friday, August 28 -----------------------------
2. To solve following problemas by usign recursion:
	a) Create an algorithm to divide two numbers (a, b).
		Ej: 
			input
				a = 60, b = 15. 
			output
				4
	b) Calculate a pow b:
		Ej: 
			input
				a = 2, b = 3
			Output
				a pow b = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8
	c) N! (N factorial) is defined as follow:
		N! = 1*2*3*4*5...*N.
		Example:
			n = 5
			n! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
			n! = 120
			5! = 120
		Create a recursive function to solve n!.
	d) A function that adds all of the elements into an array
		Ej: arr = [1, 3, 4]
			result = 8
	e) Given an array, count even and odd numbers.
		Ej: 
			Input
				arr = [2, 7, 9, 13, 8]
			Onput
				even numbers count = 2
				odd numbers count = 3
