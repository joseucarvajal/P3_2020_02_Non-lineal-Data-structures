 ------------------ Deadline: thursday, August 20 -----------------------------
	1. To set up a new GitHub repository
	2. To create a new Eclipse project. To solve the following requirements:
		There are going to be a handful of students. Each student is going to have: name, payment.
		The system should be able to: 		
			1. To create a method: "getDiffAvg(....)" Difference between payment average and the student with the greatest payment value.
				Ej:
					Students:
						Pepito		2000
						Carlitos	500
						Miguelito	700
						Natalia		3500
						Jose		2000
						
					Avg: 1740
					Student with greatest payment: 3500
					
					Output:
						Difference between payment average and student with the greatest payment is: 1760
						
			2. To shape the stack trace to show the behavior for "getDiffAvg(...)" starting from the main(....) method.
				This shape, must be done in your own notebooks.
				Inside the newly JAVA project: to create a new folder with the screenshots taken out of your notebooks.
				
			3. Into screenshots folder: attach a screenshot of your program running.
						
	3. To upload the newly created project to GitHub.
	
	4. To create workspace to present (explain) your project.
	
	5. Download the project from GitHub and test it within the newly created workspace
	
------------------ Deadline: friday, August 28 -----------------------------
2. To solve following problemas by usign recursion:
	a) Create an algorithm to divide two numbers (a, b).
		Ej: 
			input
				a = 60, b = 15. 
			output
				4
	b) Calculate a pow b:
		Ej: 
			input
				a = 2, b = 3
			Output
				a pow b = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8
	c) N! (N factorial) is defined as follow:
		N! = 1*2*3*4*5...*N.
		Example:
			n = 5
			n! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
			n! = 120
			5! = 120
		Create a recursive function to solve n!.
	d) A function that adds all of the elements of an array
		Ej: arr = [1, 3, 4]
			result = 8
	e) Given an array, count even and odd numbers.
		Ej: 
			Input
				arr = [2, 7, 9, 13, 8]
			Onput
				even numbers count = 2
				odd numbers count = 3
				
------------------ Final project, deadline: September, saturday 12 -----------------------------
Solve following problems using recursion.

	1. Given a number check whether the number is prime or not
		A prime number is a number that could be divided by 1 and itself
		Ej 1. 
			Input
				n = 18
			Output
				No
		Ej 2.
			Input
				n = 17
			 Output
				Si
				
	2. Get the greatest element in an array
		Ej1:
			Input
				arr = [3, 7, 25, 13]
			Output
				greatest = 25
				
	3. Check whether an array is a palindrome value or not. Returns 1 if a[] is a palindrome, 0 otherwise
		Ej1:
			Input
				arr = [3, 5, 8, 5]
			Output
				0
		Ej2:
			Input
				arr = [5, 8, 5]
			Output
				1
		Ej3: 
			Input
				arr = []
			Output
				1
	
	4. Write a program to count the digits of a given number using recursion.
			Ej :
				Input 
					number : 50
				Output:
					2

========================================== Second stage
------------------ Deadline: friday, October the 2nd -----------------------------	
NOTE: 
1. Create a new GitHub repository called "sales-network-linked-lists"
	Requirements
		Get the balance according to a given seller
		Get total amount of balance within the network
		The seller with the largest balance
		The seller with the smallest balance
2. Create a newtork tree with at least 10 sellers
3. Attach screenshots with the results outcome.
4. This project must be versioned into the newly GitHub repository "sales-network-linked-lists"



------------------- Final project -------------------

Saturday 17: Project support. At 8:00 a.m.

Exam: Saturday 24 in the University

Not available students for presenting test on saturday (24). Test is going to be reescheduled to sunday 25:
	Carlos Mario Franco: 8:00 a.m.
	Cristian Camilo Vasquez Rinc√≥n: 8:20 a.m.
	Cristian Stiven Franco Montoya: 8:40 a.m.
	Maicol Stiven Mancera: 9:00 a.m.
	Juan David Galvis: 9:20 a.m.

Description
	1. Create a new project called "covid-19-bst"
	2. Create new repository in GitHub called "covid-19-bst"
	3. Your program should allow to register Covid-29 patient all around the world. Requirements:
	
		1) Your system should allow to register new patients and their symptoms from a file.
		
		2) The system should not allow register the same patient twice. 
			(e.g.) :
				1) patient Maria is registered with id = 15
					Result: Maria is added to the system
				2) patient Carlos is register with id = 64
					Result: Carlos is added to the system
				3) patien maria with id = 15 tries to register. 
					Result: Maria is duplicated, so Maria couldn't be added to the system again.
							The system should continue working.
							
		3) The system should allow review one specific patient symptoms.
			e.g.:
				Carlos has 5 symptoms: feber, headache...etc, 
				If one user search Carlos by id
				the system should allow to review Carlos's symptoms
				
		4) All of the patients should pay for a threatment as per the symptoms number:
			e.g.
				Carlos has 3 symptoms, Carlos should pay: 300
				Maria has 5 symptoms, Maria should pay: 500
		
		5) The system should report the following information:
			a) How many patients does have feber
			b) What's the most common symptom
			c) What the patients payment average (should cover all of the patients)
			d) What's the patient name with the biggets number of symptoms
